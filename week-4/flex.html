                This single declaration gives us everything we need. Incredible, 
                right? We have a multiple column layout with equal-sized columns, and the columns 
                are all the same height. This is because the default values given to flex items 
                (the children of the flex container) are set up to solve common problems such as this.
                Let's recap what's happening here. Adding a display value of flex to an element makes
                 it a flex container. The container is displayed as Block-level content in terms of how it 
                 interacts with the rest of the page. When the element is converted to a flex container, its
                  children are converted to (and laid out as) flex items.
